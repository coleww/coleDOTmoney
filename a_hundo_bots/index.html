      <h5>GLOSSARY</h5>
      <ol style="text-align: left !important;">
        <li><b>bot</b>: an automaton that does the bidding of it's creator. note that the creator is still responsible for the actions of their automata.</li>
        <li><b>cyborg</b>: a bot that is not fully independent, or has some human element in it's algorithm. Uber, for example.</li>
        <li><b>_ebooks</b>: popularized by the traitor horse_ebooks, a bot that spews markov chained junk from a text corpus</li>
        <li><b>everyWord</b>: everyWord was a bot by <a href="http://www.decontextualize.com/">Allison Parrish</a> that has inspired numerous clones and remixes and also a book deal *nice* these bots usually churn through a dictionary and tweet out things like `{ADJECTIVE} {WORD}` at a speedy interval</li>
        <li><b>wowwwnetwork</b>: reply bots like @godtributes by <a href="http://jimkang.com/">Jim Kang</a> that listen for when their followers tweet something and respond with some sort of automatic nonsense. The classic wowwwnetwork was first implemented by <a href="http://casey.kolderup.org/">Casey Kolderup</a> and initially expanded by <a href="http://negatendo.net/">Brett O'Connor</a></li>
        <li><b>x-to-y</b>: bots that search twitter for a word "X" and then picks a tweet and tweets it but with that "X" replaced with "Y". These have probably been around in various incarnations for a while, but recently seem to have popped off again thanks to @boy2bot by <a href="http://hahndynasty.net/">Tobi Hahn</a></li>
        <li><b>time bots</b>: bots that use the timeline/feed/notifications to demarcate intervals of time</li>
        <li><b>event bots</b>: bots that do something special at certain times (like @IndyDaySpeech or @yulelogbot by <a href="http://muffinlabs.com/">Colin Mitchell</a>) or maybe only once per user (think @sortingbot or @YearlyAwards by <a href="http://tinysubversions.com/">Darius Kazemi</a>)</li>
        <li><b>please note that this glossary is by no means exhaustive of the types of bots that are out there</b> it is merely a list of types of bots that I have made</li>

      </ol>
      <h5>A few of my bots are collabs with <a href="https://twitter.com/swayandsea">sui</a> so I'm gonna link to them here because the way I wrote the javascript it's kinda hard to put a link tag into the slides *nice*. Shouts out to all the content creators and twitter bot makers out there! If any attributions are missing please yell at me on twitter @colewillsea because I totally deserve that if I did not attribute someone for something!!</h5>

      <h6>note: i've actually made way more than 100 twitter bots, these are just the 100 that survived. It can be a brutal world out there. </h6>
